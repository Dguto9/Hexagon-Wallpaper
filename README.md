Based on the work of [就小鹿] on the asset https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839120792.
I have used the above linked wallpaper since I got the computer I am using, and have really loved it. Early on I saw that the lines leave a ghost if the background is completely black, (thankfully there was a grey background option to help). Anyway, I figured I would look thru the code and try to debug it and found this post:

I have made a fairly temporary fix for this which does limit the fading speed and currently only works on black background.
